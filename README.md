# Data Science Projects
## Biodiversity Project
This project contains two datasets, one on species in the 4 US Midwest National Parks, and the other on observations of those species. In the notebook, I cleaned the data and performed exploratory data analysis. The goals of my analysis were to determine the distribution of species, what types of species are at the most risk, which species are observed the most, and then what is the distribution across parks for these species. In the end, I created a function that filters the data based on an input keyword like bear and return information on observations and conservation status for that animal. The project displays some more advanced python abilities that can translate into other development projects.

## Data Visualization Project
The purpose of this project was to showcase data visualization skills with Python. The goal of my analysis was to explore various relationships between a country's GDP and its life expectancy.
